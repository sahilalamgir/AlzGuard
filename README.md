### AlzGuard - An AI-driven solution for early Alzheimer's detection
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s can delay the progression of the disease, and enhance the quality of life for patients and their families. On a larger scale, it can reduce healthcare costs and alleviate the strain on healthcare systems. With this goal in mind, we use a similar framework to The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. In this institute, a group of Stanford researchers were able to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease just by applying artificial intelligence (AI) with a high success rate. Their method was to use a trained neural network which could analyze PET/MRI scans and observe minuscule differences between a healthy brain and one that was facing nerve damage.

Our proposed innovation, AlzGuard, leverages the power of advanced artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. What sets AlzGuard apart is its holistic approach: we don't rely solely on MRI scans. Instead, we integrate comprehensive clinical data to deliver a more precise diagnosis. Our unique implementation of clinical data promises to transform the landscape of Alzheimer's diagnosis, offering hope to patients and their families. With AlzGuard, we're pioneering a brighter, more informed future in Alzheimer's care.
